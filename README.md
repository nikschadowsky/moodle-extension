# moodle-extension

A  Chrome Extension to change the default behaviour of my uni's moodle 'home'-link.
In addition to that it also replaces the default behaviour of opening files: 
- Instead of opening them inside a new window or downloading, it opens them in a new tab in the same window.

This Project is currently not receiving any support due to it being finished.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Locate the 'src' directory and open manifest.json
3. Configure Pages where this Extension is enabled
4. Pack a new Chrome Extension within Chrome's Extension Manager using the 'src' directory
5. Enable it and have fun i guess

It seems like it's kinda pointless now since Moodle-Update to Version 4 changed the Homepage Hyperlink to the Dashboard. But opening files still works as intended.
